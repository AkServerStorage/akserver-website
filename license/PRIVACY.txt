This Privacy Policy describes how AkServer ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and safeguards information in connection with your use of the AkServer desktop software and related services ("Application").

AkServer is a local file-serving software with no default connectivity to external servers. We are committed to protecting your privacy and minimizing data collection.

You have full control over your data:
